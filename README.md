# Markdown Pages and Github Challenge

#### This page serves as a home page, hosting the markdown pages required for INFOTC 1600's Markdown Pages and Github Challenge

#### I've created 2 pages for this assignment, both inspired by the two most prevalent holidays around this time of year.

## Page 1

#### [Roast Turkey with Lemon, Parsley, and Garlic](TurkeyRecipe.md)

## Page 2

#### [Setting Up a Natural Christmas Tree - The Simplified Version](ChristmasTree.md)
